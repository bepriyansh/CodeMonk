'''
Monk and Square Root
Given two integers N and M, help Monk find an integer X, such that X2 % M = N and 0 â‰¤ X. 
If there are multiple values of X print smallest one. If there is no possible value of X print 1.
Note: Make sure you handle integer overflow.

Input:
First line consists of a single integer 7 denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line containing two space separated integers denoting N and M.

Output:
For each test case print the required answer.

Constraints:
1 < T < 100
0 < N < M < 10^6

# Brute Force
